# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
maintained by hand — an entry belongs in the same commit as the change it
describes, not reconstructed at release time. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); a released version
is a git tag `vX.Y.Z`, and `./release.sh` is what creates one.

Older changes than the first release below are not listed: they predate this
file, and inventing entries for them afterwards would make the log look more
reliable than it is.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Release process: `CHANGELOG.md`, `./release.sh`, and a workflow that builds
  and publishes the container image to `ghcr.io` when a `v*` tag is pushed.

### Changed

- The build version comes from `git describe` instead of a hardcoded
  `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`, so jar, tag and image tag are the same version. The image
  build passes it in with `-Pversion=`, having no `.git` of its own.

### Fixed
